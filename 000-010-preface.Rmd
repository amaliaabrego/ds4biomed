### Daniel Chen, MPH {-}

PhD student at Virginia Tech (VT) in Genetics, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology (GBCB)
working with Anne Brown and DataBridge studying
data science education and pedagogy for medical practitioners.

### Anne Brown, PhD {-}

Anne Brown holds a PhD degree in Biochemistry.
Anneâ€™s specific expertise is in
using high performance computing for molecular dynamics simulations and
virtual screening,
focusing on molecular mechanisms,
protein structure-function relationships,
and drug design.
She is also involved in the training and mentorship of undergraduate research students in these areas.
Anne collaborates with faculty and students on the integration of computational thinking and
discipline-specific computational tools relevant to science informatics tools
(bioinformatics, cheminformatics, etc)
into their research or classroom.
In addition,
she consults on and help researchers wit
data analysis, data publishing, and data visualization.
