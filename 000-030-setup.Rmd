# Setup {-#setup}

To prepare to follow along, you will need to have
the datasets downloaded,
some spreadsheet program (e.g., Excel),
and a programming language (e.g., R) installed.
See the below sections for how to get everything set up 

## Datasets {-}

## Spreadsheet {-}

Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets are the more common types of spreadsheet software used.
If you do not have Excel, there are other free options availiable:

- LibreOffice (Free and open source): https://www.libreoffice.org/
- FreeOffice (Free but closed source): https://www.freeoffice.com/en/

All of these programs can read and write Excel and comma delineated (CSV) files,
which you can use to follow along.

## Programming language {-}

Below you will find the installation instructions for setting up the programming language we will be using (e.g., R) along with its programming environment (e.g., RStudio)

### R {-}

We will be using R and RStudio for the workshop.
If you would like a video installation tutorial,
please see the
[R section of The Carpentries workshop template](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#r)
.

The links to install R can be found here: https://cloud.r-project.org/.
Navigate to the correct operating system.

```{r, fig.cap='Screenshot of the "Download and Install R" section.'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/setup/website-r_download.PNG")
```

For mac users, download the `.pkg` file under the "Latest release" section

```{r, fig.cap="Section of the Mac download page to download the Mac .pkg file."}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/setup/website-r_download-mac.PNG")
```

For Windows users, please install both the `base` version as well as `Rtools`.

```{r, fig.cap="Section of the Windows download page to download both the base and Rtools installers."}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/setup/website-r_download-windows.PNG")
```

#### RStudio {-}

After you have installed R, you can install RStudio.
We will use RStudio as the integrated development environment (IDE) to write and work with R code.
Rstudio can be downloaded from the following location: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

#### Installing R packages {-}

Once we have 
Within RStudio, there will be a "Packages" tab in the bottom right panel.
Click on the "Install" button.

```{r, fig.cap="Zoom of the Rstudio Packages tab in the bottom right quadrant showing the Install button."}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/setup/rstudio-packages_tab.PNG")
```

In the pop-up window type in "tidyverse" and click "install".

```{r, fig.cap="Install Packages dialog box after clicking the Install button showing how to install tidyverse library."}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/setup/rstudio-install_packages.PNG")
```

The Console section of RStudio will begin installing the "tidyverse" package we will be using.

#### Testing your installation {-}

When the installation is finished, you can check if the package was installed properly and will load
by scrolling down the "Packages" tab and clicking the checkbox next to "tidyverse".

```{r, fig.cap="RStudio Packages tab in the bottom right quadrant with the tidyverse library checked off."}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/setup/rstudio-check_tidyverse.PNG")
```

<!-- commenting out python section to since we are not using it yet
### Python {-}

We will be using the Anaconda distribution for Python.
The download links and instructions can be found here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/.
