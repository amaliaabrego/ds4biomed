# Code of Conduct {-#coc}

A Code of Conduct is useful to define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of professional practice. It also provides a benchmark for self-evaluation and acts as a vehicle for better identity of the community and organization.

This code (CoC) applies to any participant at the R Conference â€“ developers, participants in meetings, teleconferences, mailing lists, conferences or functions, etc. Note that this code augments rather than replaces legal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation.
